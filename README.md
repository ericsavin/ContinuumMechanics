# Continuum mechanics

Teaching documents for the undergraduate lectures on continuum mechanics and structural mechanics at [CentraleSupélec](www.centralesupelec.fr).

### Presentation and objectives

Students should be convinced of the ubiquity of the concepts and tools of mechanics not only in any industrial project implying either basic or advanced technology but also in earth and life sciences. Continuum mechanics is at the heart of climate or ice-sheet models, growth of plants and trees and even the development of an embryo or DNA replication. The basic concepts are introduced in a common unified framework for tridimensional deformable solids and slender structures - beams in particular. Problems involving mechanics at different scales illustrate the course, with some applications to civil engineering, transportation, biomechanics and nanotechnology typically.

### Syllabus

* Strain: Lagrangian description of motion, Green-Lagrange strain tensor, infinitesimal strain tensor;
* Stress: global equilibrium equations of extended bodies, Cauchy stress tensor, local equilibrium equation of the continuum;
* Strength criteria: mechanical tests, brittle fracture criteria, Tresca and von Mises criteria, stress concentrations;
* Material constitutive equations: diversity, linear elastic isotropic behaviour, thermoelasticity;
* Elasticity: properties of solutions, exact and approximate solutions, simplifications of an elastic problem;
* Beam approximation: demonstration of the assumptions of the beam model, definition of the internal loads;
* Beam approximation: approximate kinematics, constitutive equations, connections;
* Beam approximation: solution methods, buckling phenomenon.
